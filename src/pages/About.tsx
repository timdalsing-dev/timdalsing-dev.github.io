                I am a software developer and consultant from the midwest with over 20 years experience.  I mostly work in Java and Spring, but I also use Python, Bash, and many other technologies.  I have extensive experience with Kafka and streaming technologies, as well as In-memory Data Grids, SQL, and NoSQL databases.  I have worked extensively with all 3 major cloud providers, especially AWS and Azure.

                I started out as a semiconductor engineer, but switched to software.  I wrote C and C++ for many years before discovering Java.
